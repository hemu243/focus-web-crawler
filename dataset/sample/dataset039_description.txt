You can buy a brand-new home in one of three ways: buying a house already 
built on spec; having a semicustom home built as part of a development (you can 
choose from a set palette of finishes and upgrades); or having a purely custom 
home ... New homes are typically far from the city center; will you mind the 
commute?
